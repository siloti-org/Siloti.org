        <p>[1] <b>Moscow Conservatory</b>, founded 1866 by Nikolai Rubinstein. His brother, Anton Rubinstein, had
          founded the
          contrasting St. Petersburg Conservatory in 1862. The Moscow tradition (Tchaikovsky, Arensky, Taneyev) was seen
          as more
          traditional and cosmopolitan, while St. Petersburg (Balakirev, Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin, Mussorgsky) became
          more
          daringly idiosyncratic and with a focused nationalist slant (Rachmaninoff &amp; Riesemann 1934).</p>

        <p>[2] <b>Nikolai Rubinstein</b> (1835-1881). Pianist, conductor and pedagogue. Founded Moscow Conservatory
          1866.
          Advocate of the young Tchaikovsky. Premiered Balakirev&#39;s Islamey. Teacher of Sergei Taneyev, Alexander
          Siloti, and
          Emil von Sauer. (Garden 2001).</p>

        <p>[3] <b>Franz Liszt</b> (1811-1886). Pianist, composer, teacher, conductor. His myriad works range from rapid
          flare
          etudes to poetic solos and symphonic poems. He advanced possibilities for the piano and symphonic forms in
          technical
          possibilities, harmonic color, and expression of poetic essence, and developed the technique of thematic
          transformation.</p>

        <p>[4] <b>Nikolai Zverev</b> (1833-1893). Foundations teacher of Siloti, Rachmaninoff, and Scriabin. Trusted by
          the
          advanced piano faculty at Moscow Conservatory to prepare younger pupils with a strong foundation before
          handing them
          off to the advanced teachers. (Rachmaninoff &amp; Riesemann 1934).</p>

        <p>[5] Liszt&#39;s <b>Reminiscences de Norma de Bellini</b> — a solo piano concert paraphrase on themes from
          Bellini&#39;s opera. <a
            href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://youtu.be/7Wk_kr7qiH8&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1684155633152676&amp;usg=AOvVaw1enmcyLN_Y7SrrnsYBxnxJ">Recording</a>
          by Furruccio Busoni.</p>

        <p>[6] Liszt&#39;s <b>Totentanz</b>: Paraphrase on Dies irae — a concerto-like symphonic poem for piano and
          orchestra.
          Highly complex and demanding emotionally and pianistically. A letter by Liszt (5 Dec 1883; Williams 1998)
          suggests few
          pianists were able to achieve a compelling performance in these times -- but Siloti did. This work resurfaced
          in
          significant moments for Siloti (it was the final work assigned to him by N. Rubinstein, his Moscow
          Conservatory
          graduation piece, what he performed in the first Liszt Concert at Leipzig 1883, and final work performed in
          Carnegie
          Hall, NY 1929; Downes 1929). N. Rubinstein likely knew that Liszt favored this work and assigned it to Siloti
          expecting it would aid Siloti&#39;s introduction. <a

          counterpoint.
          Professor of composition at Moscow Conservatory (pupils included Rachmaninoff and Scriabin). Deeply respected
          by
          Rachmaninoff (Rachmaninoff &amp; Riesemann 1934).</p>

        <p>[8] <b>Father Dimitri Razumovsky</b> (1818-1889). Priest &amp; professor of Church music at Moscow
          Conservatory.

          pioneer
          the scholarly research of Russian chant (Duckles et al. 2001).</p>

        <p>[9] <b>Ivan Turgenev</b> (1818-1883). Renowned Russian Novelist. Captured enduring portraits of Russian
          peasantry and
          intelligentsia intent on their search for ways to better society. Turgenev visited N. Rubinstein in Paris,
          cared for
          him like&quot;a close relative,&quot; and helped transport his coffin back to Moscow (N. Rubinstein in
          Tchaikovsky
          1881).</p>

        <p>[10] <b>Imperial Russian Musical Society.</b> Established by A. Rubinstein and Count Matv. Y. Vielgorsky in
          1859.
          Mission to deepen musical appreciation and education for the people and help enable local composers and
          performers
          through concerts, competitions, grants, and opportunity for publication and performance of emerging works
          (Porfiryeva
          n.d.).</p>

        <p>[11] <b>Anton Rubinstein</b> (1829-1894). Renowned as a legendary pianist throughout Europe. Performing style
          noted
          for more spontaneity compared to his elder brother Nikolai. Rachmaninoff highly esteemed Rubinstein&#39;s
          piano tone
          (Rachmaninoff 1913). Prolific composer. Pivotal in laying foundations for Russian musical education. Founded
          Moscow
          Musical Society in 1859 and St. Petersburg Conservatory 1862.</p>

          period
          trends towards lyricism and inward, delicate passages (Kerman et al. 2001). <a

        <p>[15] <b>Johannes Kreisler</b>. A fictional character created by E.T.A. Hoffmann who distilled and
          impersonated
          musical aesthetics of the Romantic Era–including the heightened stature of music as a metaphysical art beyond

          and the importance of the artist-composer (Moraal 1994).</p>

        <p>[16] <b>Max Erdmannsdorfer</b> (1848-1905). A German conductor, pianist, and composer, who in 1882 became
          principal
          conductor of the Moscow Russian Musical Society Concerts and professor at Moscow Conservatory. Tchaikovsky
          entrusted
          him with the premiere of certain of his works, despite his concerns for Erdmannsdorfer&#39;s tendency to
          &quot;to
          indulge the public&#39;s taste of exaggerated nuances&quot; and his &quot;offhanded in his attitude to Russian
          music
          (except my own)&quot; (Tchaikovsky 1882).</p>

        <p>[17] <b>Allgemeine Deutsche Musikverein</b>. Musical society representing the New German School. Founded by
          Liszt and
          Franz Brendel in 1861 to support the performance of new, important, and rarely heard works. Liszt suggested
          much
          innovative repertoire, including many works by a range of Russian composers (Kaminiarz 1995).</p>

        <p>[18] <b>Fraulein Marie Lipsius</b> (1837-1927). Writer and music historian with the pseudonym <b>&quot;La
            Mara&quot;</b>. Close friend of Liszt and princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. Wrote a series of artful

          director in
          1822. He increased the rigor of training towards composition, requiring counterpoint, harmony, and fugue in
          addition
          to foundational piano skills. (Cook et al. 2001).</p>

        <p>[22] Liszt <b>Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in C-sharp Minor</b> (pub. 1851). <a

          of the 24 preludes by Vladimir Ashkenazy.</p>

        <p>[26] <b>&quot;quand meme&quot;</b> — a common French expression with subtle range of meanings. In this
          context, an
          English equivalent may be &quot;nevertheless&quot; with a nuance of slight exasperation.</p>

        <p>[27] <b>Georges Sand</b> was the pen name of French novelist Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin de Francueil
          (1804-1876).
          She was prolific and exceedingly popular during her time, yet was known to behave in socially rebellious ways
          (such as
          smoking or wearing men&#39;s clothing in public). She had a number of problematic romantic affairs with a

          Anton Rubinstein for one year, but like Siloti, went instead to Liszt. Liszt&#39;s pupil and secretary for the
          final
          eight years. A sensitive pianist with exquisite technique, Friedheim also authors many written reflections in
          Liszt,
          compiled by his student into the book <em>Life and Liszt</em>(New York, 1961). Unfortunately, few of his
          musical compositions
          were published and scarce manuscripts survive.</p>

        <p>[30] <b>Alfred Reisenauer</b> (1863-1907). His parents presented him to Liszt at twelve years old, and he
          soon became

        <p>[36] In 1885-86, Anton Rubinstein performed an epic series of <b>&quot;Historical Concerts&quot;</b> around
          Russia
          and Europe. These seven recitals spanned an impressive breadth of time and style. This endeavor aligned with
          Rubinstein&#39;s broader objective to help people appreciate musical masters and their works. Rachmaninoff
          comments on
          the marvel of these concerts and how they helped the audience connect with composers like Bach at a new depth
          and
          sincerity (Rachmaninoff 1913).</p>

          20,
          leaving a deep impact on Liszt and his music. Siloti also would suffer the death of a son, losing his boy Ivan
          at only
          age seven (Barber 2002).</p>

        <p>[41] Liszt&#39;s <b>Apres une lecture du Dante: Fantasia quasi Sonata</b> for solo piano (1849) after the
          poem by
          Victor Hugo. <a

          by Mikhail Pletnev.</p>

        <p>[42] <b>&quot;parterre&quot;</b> — German for &quot;ground floor&quot;</p>

        <p>[43] <b>William Humphries Dayas</b> (1864-1903). &quot;A fellow-pupil of Liszt&#39;s, Dayas was also one of
          Siloti&#39;s greatest friends.&quot; (Oxana Siloti 1979)</p>

        <p>[44] <b>Arthur Nikisch</b> (1855-1922). Conductor. A friend and collaborator of Siloti in many St. Petersburg
          Siloti
          Concerts (Oxana Siloti 1979).</p>

        <p>[45] <b>Richard Wagner</b> (1813-1883). Along with Liszt, represented the New German School in the Romantic
          Era.
          Envisioned a &quot;total artwork&quot; of music, words, theatre, light, artwork which he sought to realize in
          his
          operas, for which he was librettist and composer. His compositions showcase daring harmonic explorations and
          strategic
          use leitmotifs to link music with thematic or characteristic elements onstage.</p>

        <p>[46] <b>Julius Bluthner</b> (1824-1910). Siloti&#39;s chosen piano manufacturer. Bluthner patented a
          repetition
          action and developed pianos prized for their &quot;round, slightly romantic tone, with a particularly full
          treble.&quot;(Cranmer 2001). Bluthner tested every piano by hand until he passed this duty onto his sons.
          Provided
          much financial support to fund Siloti&#39;s endeavors. Oxana remembers, &quot;Bluthner supported my father
          generously
          at the beginning of his career. Julius Bluthner was the founder and head of the firm that manufactured the
          pianos
          Siloti played on.&quot; (Oxana Siloti 1979)</p>

        <p>[47] <b>Martin Krause</b> (1835-1918) Pianist, teacher, writer and music critic. Pupil of Liszt who later
          systematically studied Liszt&#39;s method and teaching (Methuen-Campbell 2001).</p>

        <p>[48] Wagner&#39;s final opera <b>Parsifal</b> (1882). <a
            href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DEWXNUADhMzo&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1684155633163809&amp;usg=AOvVaw1vu5QuTtc1N9JaVovkuZeZ">Recording</a>
          by the Bayreuth Festival Chorus and Orchestra.</p>

        <p>[49] <b>Joseph Joachim</b> (1831-1907). Virtuoso violinist and composer. Admired Liszt&#39;s music greatly.
          Liszt
          admired Joachim&#39;s musicality, writing &quot;You do not number among those artist that one can replace–and
          no one
          appreciates more than I all the strength of your talent, your character and individuality&quot; (Liszt to
          Joachim in
          1853 as translated in Uhde 2018).</p>

        <p>[50] <b>&quot;Stimmung&quot;</b> — German for mood, sentiment, or atmosphere</p>

        <p>[51] <b>Cosima Wagner</b> (1837-1930). Daughter of Liszt and Marie d&#39;Agoult. Married the pianist Hans con
          Bulow
          in 1857 but divorced him for Wagner in 1870. She founded Bayreuth festival with Wagner and became the core
          artistic
          director after his death in 1883.</p>

        <p>[52] <b>Alexander Glazunov</b> (1865-1936). Oxana Siloti remembers, &quot;Glazunov was a great personal
          friend of
          both my father and my mother. He dedicated his suite &#39;From the Middle Ages&#39; to my mother, and in it
          there are
          musical portraits of my parents, as the lovers in the castle, and of himself, as the troubadour at the gates.
          Glazunov
          spoke so softly that it was often hard to hear him. A favorite story is about his saying to the musicians of
          the
          orchestra at a rehearsal, barely audibly: &#39;Please, gentlemen, fortissimo!&#39;&quot; (Oxana Siloti 1979).
        </p>

        <p>[53] <b>Alexander Borodin</b> (1833-1887). Distinguished doctor, passionate chemist and imaginative Russian
          composer.
          One of the Russian Five circle of early nationalist composers. Encouraged by Balakirev and Liszt, who during a
          visit
          &quot;insisted on playing through both his symphonies with him in four-hand piano arrangements. Liszt&#39;s
          verdict
          and his advice to Borodin was, &#39;You are always lucid, intelligent and perfectly original &amp; Work in
          your own
          way and pay no attention to anyone&#39;&quot; (Liszt in Oldani 2001).</p>

        <p>[54] <b>Carl Tausig</b> (1841-1871). Virtuoso pianist, arranger. Pupil and friend of Liszt. Arranged
          Liszt&#39;s
          Faust Symphony for piano solo (see <a
            href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Ds-aR-ZFEKXY&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1684155633164915&amp;usg=AOvVaw3JJf6WwxxCC1dN-Dx5-Wjl">recording</a>
          by Istvan Lajko).</p>

        <p>[55] <b>Madame Sophie Menter</b> (1846-1918). Pupil of Liszt before Siloti. Taught at St. Petersburg
          Conservatory.
          After Liszt&#39;s death, toured Russia in concert with Siloti. (Barber 2002).</p>

        <p>[56] <b>St. Petersburg Conservatory</b>. Founded by Anton Rubinstein, who taught there alongside composer
          Nikolai
          Rimsky-Korsakov. Seen as more revolutionary and nationalistic in contrast to the more cosmopolitan Moscow
          conservatory
          (Rachmaninoff &amp; Riesemann 1934).</p>

        <p>[57] <b>Felix Mottl</b> (1856-1911). Fellow pupil of Liszt. Austrian conductor and composer and orchestrator.
          Regarded as a brilliant conductor and entrusted with many of Wagner&#39;s daring Bayreuth premieres. Worked
          with
          Arthur Nikisch at Leipzig Opera. Liszt supported the production of Mottl&#39;s works (Miller 2001), and Mottl
          would go
          on to support other emerging performances (New York Times, 1903). Mottl orchestrated, edited, and conducted
          for
          Siloti&#39;s St. Petersburg Concerts.</p>
