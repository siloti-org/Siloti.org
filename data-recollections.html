      <h3>Diaries Of Vera Ziloti</h3>

      <p>The diaries (in fourteen books, covering 1920–23 and 1930–40) of Vera Pavlovna Ziloti (née Tret’iakov, 1866–1940) contain poignant reflections of the Russian émigré’s life in New York City. With their detailed accounts of her day-to-day life with her husband, the pianist Alexander Siloti (1863–1945), these diaries provide insight into not only the topics of musical, theatrical and cultural life, but also international politics and war. The couple’s discussions and correspondence with high-status members of Russian émigré and international society (including Igor Stravinsky, Serge Koussevitzky, and Pablo Casals) are documented. The diaries also provide commentary on news stories of the time from the perspective of Ziloti’s salon in the Ansonia Hotel, New York, including musings on Soviet politics and society. When published, the diaries will form an important complement to the various editions of her classic posthumous memoir V dome Tret’iakova [In the Home of Tret’iakov] (New York: Izdatel’stvo im. Chekhova, 1954).</p>
