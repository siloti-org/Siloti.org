    <h3>Alexander Siloti and Igor Stravinsky: Creative Connections</h3>

    <p>The study of the letters of Russian musicians is of interest all over the world and clearly lags behind the
      popularity of their work. The author considers the storyline of the correspondence of I.F. Stravinsky and A.I.
      Siloti associated with the performance in St. Petersburg of his compositions based on manuscripts. The details of
      the preparation of the premieres in the enterprise “Concerts of A. Siloti” are given. The creative and friendly
      relations between Siloti and Stravinsky are analyzed on the basis of published and unpublished archival sources.
      The role of Siloti in promoting the works of contemporary composers is shown. The epistolary heritage of two
      famous musicians reveals the professional and human relationships of outstanding creators and reflects the
      artistic life of the capital at the beginning of the 20th century. The archival collections of St. Petersburg and
      Moscow served as the source base.</p>

    <p>The present study is based on the materials of correspondence between the pianist and conductor A.I. Ziloti and
      his teacher P.I. Tchaikovsky in the period from 1886 till 1893. The last letter was sent by the great composer a
      month before his death. Throughout his life, Ziloti was a propagandist of Pyotr Ilyich’s works and one of the best
      editors and proofreaders of his works. The study reveals little-known facts about the life and creative activities
      of outstanding musicians Alexander Ilyich Ziloti and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The letters trace the features of
      the relationship between two talented individuals who were congenial souls. The epistolary legacy was a testament
      to their fruitful friendship, which left a noticeable mark in the history of Russian musical culture at the turn
      of 19th and 20th centuries. The correspondence between A.I. Ziloti and P.I. Tchaikovsky can be called a document
      of the epoch, reflecting in detail the specifics of its musical life and creative process. The study is dedicated
      to two memorable dates – the 180th anniversary of Tchaikovsky’s birth and the 75th anniversary of Ziloti’s death.

    <h3>A. I. ZILOTI AND HIS ROLE IN THE REVIEW OF J. S. BACH’S CREATIVITY</h3>

    <p>Renowned pianist and conductor of concert enterprise in 1903-1918, editor and transcriber with writings of more
      than 50 authors, Alexander Ilyich Siloti (1863-1945) entered the history of music as one of the most prominent
      representatives of world culture at the beginning of the 20th century. However, so far in Russia there is neither
      a monograph about him, nor fundamental works devoted to his creative life and revealing all its versatility. One
      of the main dominants of this activity in its different periods would be his commitment to the work of Johann
      Sebastian Bach. “Not long ago,” wrote V. G. Karatygin in 1913 in one of the reviews of his concerts “we did not
      know at all and did not like Bach… Siloti has a huge merit in the further development of this interest.” The
      purpose of the study is to identify the role of Siloti in the historical reception of Bach&#39;s work, including a
      typology of Siloti&#39;s musical manuscripts for the study of his transcriptions and arrangements (especially
      those that have survived handwritten only) and opening the view of Siloti into the history of adaptations and
      editions of Bach&#39;s works compared to the work of his predecessors and contemporaries.</p>

    <h3>Alexander Ilyich Ziloti: pianist, teacher, organiser of concert life</h3>

    <p>At the turn of the 19th-20th centuries, a whole galaxy of outstanding creative figures emerged in the history of
      Russian musical culture, among which Alexander Ilyich Ziloti (1863-1945) occupies a prominent place - an educator
      musician who clearly showed himself in many areas of performing and musical and social activities as a pianist ,
      ensemble player and accompanist, teacher, publicist, editor, author of transcriptions and arrangements, conductor,
      creator of concert enterprise. Contemporaries spoke of the pianistic art of AI Siloti as a significant phenomenon
      in piano performance. His short stay as a teacher at the Moscow Conservatory left a bright mark on the creative
      fate of his students, among them - S. Rachmaninov, K. Igumnov, A. Goldenweiser. The most important work of
      Ziloti&#39;s entire life was the &quot;Concerts of A. Ziloti&quot; organized by him in 1903 and lasting until 1918
      - an enterprise founded by a performing musician for the first time in the history of Russia. Thanks to
      outstanding organizational skills and the talent of a musician, they successfully competed with other concert
      enterprises. Both as a performer and as an organizer of concert life, Siloti became one of the first in Russia to
      revive interest in the creative heritage of J. S. Bach and actively promote the music of Russian and foreign
      contemporaries. At the same time, Ziloti&#39;s outstanding personality, his large-scale and diverse creative
      activity still remains an insufficiently studied page in the history of Russian musical culture.</p>

      of the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth century. The paper also discusses Siloti’s revisions of Franz Liszt’s
      Piano Concerto No. 2. The first chapter is a brief biography of Alexander Siloti (1863-1945). The second comprises
      details of his musical background, influential teachers who affected his life, and his contributions to the great
      composers of his era. The third chapter is a comparison of Liszt’s Piano Concerto No. 2, published by B. Schott
      and Siloti’s manuscript of the concerto. This essay also deals with his manuscript of this concerto along with his
      performance styles and techniques as a transcriber of Liszt’s music.</p>

    <h3>An Examination of Alexander Siloti’s Printed Solo Piano Transcriptions of Works by J. S. Bach</h3>

    <p>In this document I will examine Alexander Siloti’s (1863-1945) fourteen transcriptions for solo piano of works by
      J. S. Bach (1685-1750) that are currently in print. I will compare all of these transcriptions to Bach’s originals
      and discuss Siloti’s musical treatment of Bach’s music. When possible and relevant, I will compare certain works
      to transcriptions of the same pieces by contemporaries of Siloti, including Ferruccio Busoni (1866-1924), Ignaz
      Friedman (1882-1948), Wilhelm Kempff (1895-1991), Camille Saint-Saëns (1835-1921), and Theodor Szántó (1877-1934).
      I will also consider other Bach transcriptions made by Siloti in instances where he completed a solo piano
      transcription and one or more transcriptions of the same work for other instrumental combinations. It is my hope
      that pianists will become acquainted with a small but excellent body of work by a neglected artist due to this
      examination of Siloti’s Bach transcriptions. To this end I will give a brief overview of the history of the
      nineteenth century piano transcription, Bach as a transcriber, and the legacy of Bach’s music as transcribed for
      the piano. I will also provide important details about Siloti’s biography, and discuss his style and technique as
      a transcriber of Bach’s music. Lastly, I will examine Siloti’s fourteen Bach transcriptions for solo piano in
      detail</p>

    <h3>Lost in the Stars: The Forgotten Musical Life of Alexander Siloti</h3>

    <p>The flagship English language biography describing Siloti&#39;s pivotal perspective on music history and his
      extraordinary musical sense, interactions with Rubinsteins, Liszt, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, Prokofiev,
      Stravinsky, Debussy, Ravel, etc., and Siloti&#39;s time at Juilliard (1925-1942).</p>

    <p>Alexander Siloti (1863-1945), a name associated with musical greats such as Tchaikovsky, Liszt, and Rachmaninoff,
      was a pianist, conductor, impresario, advocate for new music, and mentor of new composers; a musical great in his
      own right. Lost in the Stars is Charles Barber&#39;s recreation of the vital times in which Siloti lived: the St.
      Petersburg musical culture and Russia&#39;s Silver Age of music. Barber highlights Siloti&#39;s move to America,
      where he spent his days teaching, far away from his remarkable career that earned him glowing reviews in Russia.
      Barber also focuses on Siloti&#39;s own tastes and aesthetics and his role in the broader artistic life of his
      era. The text also examines the &quot;why&quot; behind Siloti&#39;s almost forgotten legacy and discusses the slow
      reappearance of Siloti&#39;s music in our times, partly due to the ardent work of his admirers.</p>
